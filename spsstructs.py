           deck effectively inserting data into the given
           spreadsheet/sheet name from data in the given database if
           any is provided.

           If the database is not given, then it is retrieved from the
           configuration file. If it exists in the configuration file but is
           given here with override=True then the one given here is used
           instead. The same rule applies to the name of the spreadsheet to
           create and also the sheet name.

           Note that all parameters are optional. If they are not
           given, then they should be supplied in the configuration
           file.
